# On-Sums-of-Practical-Numbers-and-Polygonal-Numbers

This is the repository of Python codes used for the numerical computations for the conjectures of the paper "On Sums of Practical Numbers and Polygonal Numbers." The codes in [`practical_one_polygonal_sum.ipynb`](../main/practical_one_polygonal_sum.ipynb) are used to check the representations of natural numbers as a sum of a practical number and a polygonal number. The codes in [`practical_two_polygonal_sum.ipynb`](../main/practical_two_polygonal_sum.ipynb) are used to check the representations of natural numbers as a sum of a practical number and two polygonal numbers.
